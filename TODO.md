I saw that unintuitively a run involving no mortgage broke even quicker than a run involving a mortgage. It turned out the code was running as intended. The leveraged scenario assumes an initial investment of just the deposit, not the entire household for the renter simulation.

I originally wrote this calculator with the goal to compare rent vs buying rather than trying to optimise a mortgage.
Pros for adding feature:
* It would be nice, intuitively to simulate buying the entire house, part of the house or no house in one run
* This feature seems practical, it allows us to decide an appropriate mortgage size in a complex environment.
Cons for adding feature:
* It seems very intuitive that stock beats property long term returns even w/ leverage, there's an argument that the calculator just needs to compare rent vs minimum mortgage when mortgage rate is less than expected long term stock returns.
