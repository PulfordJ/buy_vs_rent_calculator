find_rent_price_intersection.py allows you to find what rent is about equal to buying in terms of return for a given number of parameters when considering a bunch of parameters (interest_rate, property price, downpayment, investment return percentage, service charge etc).

example.py just plays the parameters of a given rent vs buy simulation for as long as specified, prints out stats like teh final difference and a graph showing each year.
